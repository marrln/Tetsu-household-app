Tetsu - Household Assistant App
==================================

Tetsu is a household assistant app that helps track items, manage shopping lists, monitor prices and discounts, and suggest purchases based on routines. Built on Google's Compose Inventory App, it's a foundation for smarter home organization and budgeting.

## Vision

Tetsu aims to simplify household management by:
- **Smart Shopping Lists**: Track items with different purchase frequencies (weekly eggs, monthly shampoo, etc.)
- **Intelligent Suggestions**: Get reminders when items might be running low
- **Price Tracking**: Monitor prices and discounts to make better financial decisions
- **Purchase History**: Record extra purchases made on discount
- **Future Enhancements**: Cleaning schedules, chore reminders, and more

## Why the name "Tetsu"?
The name combines two Japanese concepts: "Tetsu" (鉄) meaning "iron" - symbolizing strength and reliability as an essential tool - and "tetsudai" (手伝い) meaning "to help" or "to assist." Together, they represent the app's mission: to be a strong, dependable assistant for your household management needs.
